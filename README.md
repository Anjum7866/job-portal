# Job Portal Project README

Welcome to the Candidate Application Platform! This platform allows users to view job listings, filter jobs based on various criteria, and seamlessly browse through job opportunities. Please note that for the scope of this assignment, only the "Search jobs" section has been implemented.

## Description

The Candidate Application Platform is a web application designed to streamline the job search process. Users can easily search for job listings, filter them based on their preferences, and apply to relevant positions. The platform features a user-friendly interface, responsive design, and infinite scroll functionality for a seamless browsing experience.

- View job button/link

### Filters

Filters are available to refine job listings based on the following criteria:
